# Computer-Vision-with-CNNs

## Description

Computer vision has become prevalent in our society with its applications spanning across multiple domains like medicine, mapping, drones, and self-driving cars.

New developments in the neural network field have drastically improved the speed at which these images are processed and the performance of these state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. This course focusses on how to build a convolutional neural network to approach the problem of image recognition and fine-tune the network for optimized performance.
